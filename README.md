## Aim: 
To Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

## Algorithm: 
1.	Choose the Tool: You select an AI music generator like Soundraw, which allows you to generate relaxing music with a customizable prompt.
2.	Prompt the AI:
Prompt: "Generate a calming ambient soundscape for meditation. Include soft, atmospheric background sounds like wind and distant chimes. Overlay a gentle, slow piano melody with simple harmonic progressions and a slow tempo. The music should evoke a peaceful, zen-like environment."
3.	Adjust Parameters:
o	Tempo: Slow (60 bpm)
o	Dynamics: Soft
o	Style: Ambient/Calming
4.	Generate Audio: You generate the first version.
5.	Refinement: Listen to the result, and if needed, refine with feedback:
Refinement Prompt: "Increase the prominence of wind sounds and make the chimes more ethereal, subtle in the background."
6.	Final Output: The system now produces a final, polished version that you can use in your app.

## Output:


## Result: 
The Prompt is executed successfully
